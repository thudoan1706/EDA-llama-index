      "Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 942 2 of 16 Coinage of the term “Mediterranean diet” and its breakthrough to the attention of the medical public were made possible by the work of Ancel Keys, an American scientist who was the first to notice the relationship between the low incidence of cardiovascular disease in some traditional Mediterranean communities and their specific dietary habits [4]. Ensuing research confirmed the benefits brought by Mediterranean-derived dietary interventions not only in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, but also in the therapeutic approach of obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cancer or neurodegenerative diseases [5,6]. In the moment when recognition of the health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet has become universal, its paradoxical fate is that it is at risk of being extinguished in its homeland territories. Globalization, importation of Western habits, changes in lifestyle and the environment specific to modern civilization have brought a heavy toll on the traditional Mediterranean diet [7]. At the same time, when international guidelines include it among the recommended healthy dietary patterns [8], the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) considers the Mediterranean diet an “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Urgent Safeguarding” [9]. Given this contradictory stand between universal medical recognition and cultural extinction, this paper aims to review the current information referring to the inception and development of the Mediterranean diet, the major medical evidence supporting its health benefits, and the challenges it must outrun in order to avoid erosion, to maintain survival and sustainability, and to serve public health with the best resources it can offer. 2. The Mediterranean Diet: An Environment-Driven Food Culture The term “Mediterranean diet” is used today to describe the traditional dietary habits of countries neighboring the Mediterranean Sea, mostly Greece and Southern Italy. Nevertheless, it should be understood as more than a strict reference to the preferences these populations exhibit in their daily food selection, since the original meaning of the word diaita in Greek does not refer to just food or eating choices, but to a certain “way of living” which corresponds better to the modern concept of “lifestyle” [7]. It is relatively difficult to pinpoint the beginnings of this diet, but it most probably developed along with populations living in the Mediterranean Basin ever since the dawn of civilization.\n",

       "The Indo-Mediterranean diet is a dietary approach that combines elements of the traditional Mediterranean diet with foods commonly consumed in the Indian subcontinent. This diet includes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, walnuts, almonds, mustard or soybean oil, which are rich in alpha-linolenic acid. Research has shown that following an Indo-Mediterranean diet can lead to significant health benefits, particularly in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. In a study involving Indian patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease or high cardiovascular risk, those following the Indo-Mediterranean diet experienced a notable reduction in the rate of cardiovascular death and risk for non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to a control group following a different dietary approach."
