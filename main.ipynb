       "  'Gómez-Pinilla Page 7 which DHA affects brain plasticity and cognition are starting to be elucidated. For example, DHA dietary supplementation has been found to elevate levels of hippocampal BDNF and enhance cognitive function in rodent models of brain trauma81. DHA might enhance cognitive abilities by facilitating synaptic plasticity and/or enhancing synaptic membrane fluidity; it might also act through its effects on metabolism, as DHA stimulates glucose utilization82 and mitochondrial function83, reducing oxidative stress (OS)81. Most of the studies in humans have been directed at evaluating the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing the cognitive deficit that is associated with psychiatric disorders. Several other, widely publicized, attempts to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the performance of school children have been carried out. A randomized double-blind controlled trial in which half of the children received omega-3 fatty acids and the other half received placebos is being conducted across several schools in Durham, UK84. Previous studies from the same investigators showed that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation was associated with reduced cognitive deficits (in reading and spelling, and teaching-rated behaviour) in children affected with developmental coordination disorder — that is, in children with specific impairments of motor function that are independent of their motor ability 85. In the new studies, children were selected on the basis that “they were not fulfilling their potential at school” but their general ability was deemed “normal”, and they were subjected to regular tests to measure their coordination, concentration and academic ability. According to preliminary results84, some level of improvement in school performance was observed in the group receiving omega-3 fatty acids, unleashing a flurry of speculations from the media. Although the results of the Durham study require scientific scrutiny for validation, they seem to agree with those of another study86 in which omega-3 fatty acids (DHA 88 mg per day and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 22 mg per day) and micro-nutrients (iron, zinc, folate and vitamins A, B6, B12 and C) were provided in a drink mix to 396 children (6–12 years of age) in Australia and 394 children in Indonesia. The results showed higher scores on tests that measured verbal intelligence and learning and memory after 6 and 12 months in both boys and girls in Australia, but in only girls in Indonesia.']}"
